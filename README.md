# Tiny Components

Replace placeholder frames with polished design system components in Figma.

## Features

- Auto-detect frames that match mapping rules and select them on canvas.
- Replace matched frames with DS components while keeping layout.
- Manual mapping: map a selected layer to a component ID.
- Searchable component picker for manual mapping.
- Click any mapping to select its node on canvas.

## Usage

1. Open the plugin in Figma.
2. Use **Find Components** to select all frames that match mapping rules.
3. Use **Replace from DS** to replace all matched frames.
4. For manual mapping:
	- Select a layer on canvas.
	- Choose a component in the searchable picker.
	- Click **Map** to save the mapping.
	- Click a mapping row to jump to that node on canvas.

Notes:
- Card components are inserted with their default slot content (no auto-population).
